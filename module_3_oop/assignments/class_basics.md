# Class Basics

## Description
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of **object-oriented programming** by creating a simple Python class. You may design a class to represent **any object you like** (e.g., person, vehicle, animal, device, building, etc.).

The goal is to demonstrate the **structure** and **basic functionality** of a Python class, including attributes, methods, and instantiation.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `simple_class.py` in your GitHub repository.
2. In this file, define a class with the following required elements:
   - A class declaration
   - An `__init__()` constructor method
   - At least one attribute
   - At least one method
3. Instantiate the class in a `main()` function.
4. Include:
   - A call to one of the class's methods
   - A call to one of its attributes
5. Follow **PEP 8** and **PEP 20** guidelines for clean, readable code.
6. Include **type hints** and **docstrings** for all functions and methods.
7. Push your code to GitHub and submit the URL of the file.

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] File named `simple_class.py`.
- [ ] Class declaration with `__init__` and one method.
- [ ] At least one attribute used.
- [ ] Instance created and method called.
- [ ] Type hints and docstrings included.
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 and PEP 20 style guides.
- [ ] File added, committed, pushed to GitHub.
- [ ] GitHub URL submitted.

## Grading Criteria

| Criteria                                     | Points |
