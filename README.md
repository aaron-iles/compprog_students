# Computer Programming
## Course Overview
Python is a general purpose interpreted language with a powerful set of libraries, simple syntax, and large user base. It won Language of the Year in 2007, 2010, 2018, 2020, and 2021. The TIOBE index, a tool that measures the popularity of programming languages, has ranked Python in the top three since 2018. While it is easy for beginners to learn, Python’s use cases are extremely diverse. Python can be found creating machine learning models for Google, exploring big data from Twitter, defending critical infrastructure in the government, and even running the entirety of Instagram’s backend.
This course is an introduction to the Python programming language for students without prior programming experience. We cover data types, control flow, object-oriented programming, parallelism, and graphical user interface-driven applications. The examples and problems used in this course are drawn from diverse areas such as text processing, HTML and web programming, data mining, console games, web scraping, and task automation.
## Grading and Coursework
Students’ grades are unweighted and calculated by dividing the number of points earned by the number of possible points. There will be (nearly) weekly brief quizzes and some light homework, but the class will primarily be project-based.
All coursework and information will be posted in Google Classroom.
