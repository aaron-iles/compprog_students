# Hello $USER

## Description
For this assignment you will create a hello world script. You will submit the script (a text file with a .py extension) for this assignment and it must be named `hello_user.py`. Remember to add, commit, push and submit the URL of the file when you're done.

## Instructions
- For 5 points, have the script print `Hello ____` where the blank is the name of the person running the script. Note that hard coding "Aaron" or some other name in there doesn't count. It should handle printing the name of ANYONE running the script not just me.
- For an extra point, add helpful comments about what the function is doing. This can be done with a docstring (triple quoted string) or comments (use # to create a comment).
- For an extra point, format the script using PEP 8 standards. (I will look for appropriate function names, variable names, and spacing.)
- For an extra point, set up the script with the `if __name__ == '__main__'` convention. (use Google to find examples of how to do this)
- As always, if you're not sure how to do something just Google it! If you're still stuck just message me.
