# Hello $USER

## Description
For this assignment, you will create a "Hello, World!" style script in Python. The script must greet the user running it by name and must be named `hello_user.py`. When you're finished, make sure to **add**, **commit**, **push**, and **submit the URL** of the file in your GitHub repository.

## Instructions

- Create a Python script named `hello_user.py`.
- The script should print:
  ```
  Hello <username>
  ```
  where `<username>` is dynamically obtained based on the user running the script. **Hard-coding a name is not allowed.**
- Follow these additional steps for extra credit:
  - **+1 point**: Add helpful comments or a docstring to explain the purpose of the script.
  - **+1 point**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) formatting standards (e.g., clear variable names, consistent indentation, spacing).
  - **+1 point**: Use the `if __name__ == '__main__':` convention to run your code.

Use Google to look up any of these requirements, and don't hesitate to ask questions if youâ€™re stuck.
