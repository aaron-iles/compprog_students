# Types

## Description
Demonstrate your knowledge of various types in Python by creating and assigning values to different variable types.

## Instructions

1. Copy the block of code below and paste it into a file in your Git repository named `type_worksheet.py`:
    ```python
    # Store any integer in the var "a".
    a = 

    # Store any float in the var "b".
    b = 

    # Add a and b and store it in "c" so that c is the sum of a and b.
    c = 

    # Now state what the type of the var c is. (Hint: it will be float, int, str, bool, etc.)
    type_c = 

    # Store any string in the var "d".
    d = 

    # Store any boolean in the var "e".
    e = 

    # Make a list and store it in "f".
    f = 

    # Make a set and store it in "g".
    g = 

    # Make a dictionary and store it in "h".
    h = 
    ```

2. Fill in each variable (`a` through `h`) with an appropriate value for its type.
3. Add, commit, and push the file to your GitHub repository.
4. Submit the assignment by copying the URL of your pushed file (`type_worksheet.py`) and pasting it in the assignment submission.
