# Oh Christmas Tree!

## Description
This exercise is to write a Python program that prints a Christmas tree.

## Instructions
Write a Python program that will draw a Christmas tree of a specified height. This assignment will be graded out output only. I will not look at your source code at all, but I will test your program with a handful of test cases to make sure it works appropriately. The number of test cases you successfully pass determines your grade.

### Test Cases
```bash
./tree_builder.py 10
./tree_builder.py  20
./tree_builder.py  5
./tree_builder.py  1
./tree_builder.py  0
./tree_builder.py  10000000
./tree_builder.py  -10
./tree_builder.py  5.8
./tree_builder.py  abc
./tree_builder.py 
```

#### Expected Results
Should print a tree 10 characters in height.
Should print a tree 20 characters in height.
Should print a tree 5 characters in height.
Should print a message explaining what the minimum height of the tree can be.
Should print a message explaining what the minimum height of the tree can be.
Should print a message explaining what the maximum height of the tree can be.
Should print a message explaining that the tree height must be a positive integer.
Should print a message explaining that the tree height must be a positive integer.
Should print a message explaining that the tree height must be a positive integer.
Should print a help message.
