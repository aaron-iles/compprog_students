# Calculator

## Description
For this assignment you will create a module (that's a single Python file) that contains four functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide. 

## Instructions
Ensure each function accepts exactly two arguments. These args can be named whatever you want, but they should be descriptive ([remember PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [PEP 20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)). Each function should perform the arithmetic operation of its namesake and return a result. Errors **do** need to be handled gracefully.

This assignment will be completed in pieces as we discuss different elements of the project.

I will grade this assignment on the following:
- [ ] Have they written all 4 functions?
- [ ] Does each function run without syntax errors?
- [ ] Does each function do what it says it does?
- [ ] Is the code mostly PEP 20 compliant?
- [ ] Is the code mostly PEP 8 compliant?
- [ ] Is each function documented with a docstring?
- [ ] Is each arg of each function documented with proper type hinting?
- [ ] I attached a script I wrote as an example of the formatting I expect.
